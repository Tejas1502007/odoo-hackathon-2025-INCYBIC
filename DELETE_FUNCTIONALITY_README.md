# Item Delete Functionality

This document describes the item deletion functionality implemented for the ReWear app.

## Overview

The delete functionality has been moved from the item listing process to the user dashboard, where users can manage their listed items. This provides a better user experience and follows proper UX patterns.

## ‚úÖ **Where Delete Functionality is Available**

### üè† **User Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
- **Location**: "My Items" tab in the user dashboard
- **Access**: Only the item owner can see delete options
- **Visibility**: Delete button appears on each item card when `showActions` is true

### ‚ùå **Not Available During Item Listing**
- **AddItem Page**: No delete options during the listing process
- **Reason**: Users should focus on uploading and describing their items
- **Management**: Items are managed after listing, not during creation

## üéØ **How to Delete Items**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Go to `/dashboard` in your app
